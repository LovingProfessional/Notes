bouncy, jubilant

dead kid in the sink
and I think it's a 
world of too- tomb- tumeric

boo boo bouncing on someone elses back
rub my knuckle nerves
give me a switch blade

Gabriel's pretending he's the sargeant
at compound doubleyou take away the sunburns

she's got the wax flit calm with it
taking a wheel to the sky
if you want to get high

She looks dead when she's sunbathing
I hope the sand sticks to her skin

dumb diddos get the corn out your tum-mee
and run me
