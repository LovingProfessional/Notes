Some monkeys are in a cage suspended by crudely bent chicken wire in a dark warehouse of some kind.
Oh, there. It's some glowing chemical dripping down from the roof, just a few scraps and they've cooled on the way down.
Back teeth gnash and grind, and a handful of monkeys become super-intellegent monkeys, bust out the cage. Lock it up behind.  All it takes is some leverage. Then, you know, start crawling around. They're monkeys, they love to climb. Their bodies are projected up the wire, as if it were an instant unavoidable reaction, a force of nature akin to gravity. There's a light at the top, so they're squinting their eyes but they don't care, they're following attraction, it's in their bloodstream by now. Then after they crawl for a while, they get tired and scared because they look down now and theres an empty warehouse floor a hundred feet below them.
