I'm just crude enough to be clever

Lick-lined lips for colored chips

smaller shallots have more intense flavor than the large ones

Our children don't know nothing we don't teach 'em

Just loose enough to get my mind clean

She's saying something that's going to affect me, but I can't take my eyes off the glass and the lights

Calloused mouth from sipping boiling water

Washed down by booze men made from flesh

Cops, cats, coccoons coccaine and death

Wash my view out with the sky

Ain't nothing but carbon in my lungs

Dunno what I've become 'till I've became

We distribute a hunred thousand feelings a week

Kush, kicks, kanoos, king kong, and chess

Lead paint and gasoline, put it in your pipe and toke

One time you told me that I was nothing but a fat-ass and a joke

It's sad but it's true 'cuz your not the only shrew I poke

clinically cynical miracle master murdermind

redevue with those grey demons fast on a track to philosophy

hard to find anybody as soft rock as me


if thats slanderous than pimpery is panderous

scrape screeens in skinny jeans;

My parents don't know that I can hear them through the walls

If the bed is too small we can sleep in the tub


I know that it's fine 'cuz there's blood on the sun

there's a scratch on her lips where a hand used to be

There's a star on her hat, stats in cahoots with a kissing booth

fish scales, dragon tales, tax the television sales

I can't recieve what I already have

I can't bathe in the body I am

I can't believe in the liquid I cling to

I cannot raise myself to be a man

Taking
