That scours IMDB looking for b-list acters, gathering their contact information and a couple movies they've been in
actually I'd probably have to just find their names, then locate and extract information from facebook/linkedin whatever
then it will automatically email all of them with a personalized message saying 
'yo I'm an independant film maker
I saw you in blah blah blah and blah blah blah
I have a role I think you would be just perfect for
Can't pay you upfront, 
you're guarenteed so and so amount if this film is ever sold
likely just to be shown at independant film festivals
let me know if you're even remotely interested in working with me or doing independant films at this point in your career
and we can talk about the substance of this project in more depth'
