scramble the frames at a medium low framerate while maintaining a more or less linear flow of the images

show a series of medium close ups of people doing random things, concealing their eyes every time. Show a series of close ups of people doing the same things in a scrambled order while breaking the fourth wall and revealing just their eyes.    perhaps this whole thing would be interlaced with character movemets. 
    
MCU of couple lying under a tree at night. Frame is altered to appear convex. fish eye or whatever. With the center of the frame dividing them.

take a panorama image and shape it into a bow, then have a character walk around it

cover up one vertical half of the screen with a character's profile, the other half a haphazardly tilting 

for the fourth all night when the drums drop out, close up on the male's eyes, looking very tired, then glancing slightly off screen, then (maybe looking at the camera) curl subtley into a smile

show interlacing shots of flashbacks of the couple getting ready in their respective households (graphically matched, possibly with parallel placement in its positioning along side the song)
    probably the dirtier side of getting ready, putting paste in the guys hair, wiping three timesor washing genitals. 
    extra attention to normal hygienic activities
    both are visibly filled with giddy nervous energy about the meeting
    show the guys hair being jelled as a cut from the girl ruffling it and similar things to provide graphical relevance 





reverse the track for one long shot of a character walking backwards


observations about the song itself:
    Structure:
        sloppy low fidelity bass intro
        :09
        intro
            guitar apreggio plays 4 times before drums come in
            
            drums and guitar play together 4 times then vocals

        vocal verse 1
            phrases devided into four measure loops, then four measures of major 7th variation and repeated
            phrase 1
                
                slight drop in the temperature
                callous something but you'll never something in time
                is captured, white out
            phrase 2
                :42
                see the city something something something somethig
                watch the rain drops cover the place
                do you mind?
                do you mind?

           phrase 3 - different
                no, no, no, no, no I don't
                no, no, no, no, no I don't
                no, no no, no no I don't
                no, no, no, no, no I don't
            1:15
            phrase 4 
                roller coaster on whooooo
                toniiiiiight
                rollar coaster on whoooooooo
                toniiiiiight

            1:39
        chorus 
            all night * 4
            third is aggressive final attempt, fourth is futility and submission
            2:18
            four repeats of a militant reload
        verse 2
            phrase 1
                starts like phrase 1 but more aggressive
                the seventh chords get the beginning of a scream
            phrase 2
                gets quieter and more submissive the second time
        bridge
            vocals drop out where the 'no i don't's used to be 
            phrase 4
        chorus
            identical, pretty much
            the march at the end is sort of a dying spider arpeggiation which continues
            the drums starts concluding, then let it ring once more, then starts hitting the crash every measure until it drops out
            lets the guitar get in the last lick
            drops out to laughing children
                



rough sb:
        sloppy low fidelity bass intro

            drums and guitar play together 4 times then vocals

                --an overexposed shot of a street light calms down and adjusts, then tilts down to the couple holding hands, joint in hand, getting rained on, lying down on the windsheild and looking at the sky
                watch the rain drops cover the place
                --shot from inside the car of them lying close and passing joint, synchronize the rain drops with the guitar's arpegiation by using hidden matte's pasting over all areas of the car without drops all over areas with drops, allowing them to drop one at a time in rhythm
                do you mind?
                --shot reverse shot of an exchange of smiles
                do you mind?

                --the instant as they walk into the door, the young man's face changes expression and becomes sinister, pulls her by her hair and throws her against

                --On the crash symbol, he throws down some ceramic or glass object on the girl who is concealed by some furniture
            all night
                --Viscous running blood against fragments of whatever was thrown

                --As he turns his head to the side, the girl appears in his arms and they mack hard and breif
            --------------------This is where I had to stop due to batteries, but I was thinking the babe would kill him in the next chorus and maybe put him in a blender and bathe in him
            --at the end, they're both looking into each others eyes and then break the fourth wall and smile wildly as their mouths overflow with blood and it fades out 
                --maybe parked in front of a playground or something
